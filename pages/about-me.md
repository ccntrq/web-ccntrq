I'm a software developer, open source enthusiast and Linux Nerd located in
Hannover, Germany. Most of my open source work is done as `ccntrq`.

I work as a fullstack web developer, but my interest for software development
and programming languages goes way beyond that.

In my professional career I've been working with `perl` and `typescript`
extensively. For my side projects I'm working with `Haskell` most of the time.
For my personal delight, I take part in the [The Weekly
Challenge](https://theweeklychallenge.org/) using `perl` some of the times.
