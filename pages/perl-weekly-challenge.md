title: The Weekly Challenge
---

For my personal delight I take part in the [The Weekly
Challenge](https://theweeklychallenge.org/) most weeks.

_The Weekly Challenge_ was started by [Mohammad S Anwar](http://www.manwar.org)
in 2019. Every week there are two tasks of varying difficulty.  Most
contributors use Perl or Raku to solve the tasks, but over time we've reached a
point were there's an impressive amount of guest contributions aswell.

Below you can find all my submissions, as well as my blog posts about some of
the solutions. I use Perl mostly, while also submitting solutions in Raku and
Haskell sometimes.

There is no comment section on this site. If you have any questions, suggestions
or find an error in my posts or solutions please create an issue in [this
repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ccntrq/web-ccntrq) or drop me a
[mail](/pages/contact.html)
